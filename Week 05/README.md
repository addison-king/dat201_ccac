### Practice with QGIS on your own:

Look through the [PASDA](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/) data sets, and make a map and a data-based assertion that's interesting to you. (If you want to use [WPRDC](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset) instead, you can.) If none of the data sets speak to you, please look at how many [oil and gas](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=283) or [coal](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=271) operations are being run in the [Chesapeake Bay watershed](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=59) (or Allegheny County or any other subset of the state of interest to you). There are also [oil and gas water pollution control facilities](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=284), if you'd like to look at those. Don't forget to cite your data sources, and keep a log of the changes you make, so that another data analyst could follow your steps. 

Try making an attractive layout of your PASDA-data-based map that tells the story you intend to tell. 

Put your map, log, and layout into a folder (please put your first name and NOT your last name somewhere in the name of the folder), and upload it to [our shared directory](https://acdccac-my.sharepoint.com/personal/edarsow_acd_ccac_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9hY2RjY2FjLW15LnNoYXJlcG9pbnQuY29tLzpmOi9nL3BlcnNvbmFsL2VkYXJzb3dfYWNkX2NjYWNfZWR1L0VrUzQzNF9LMVV4RnZjbDBQNEI5WjAwQnMwV2dkRjF1MDZpQTdKZFJxbEtXR2c%5FcnRpbWU9eko3alpIQ3gxMGc&viewid=e2ddbbdb%2D20ac%2D4c4b%2D9dff%2Db8735d690d4b&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fedarsow%5Facd%5Fccac%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fdata%5Fanalytics%2Fdat%5F201%5F20sp%5Fstudent%5Fwork), inside the folder "maps!" -> "practice_maps."
