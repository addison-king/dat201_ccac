# Homework

You actually need to have QGIS up and running next week. For real. If you got it working in your virtual machine, great! If you want to run it on your own machine, in your favorite operating system, that's also great! It'll be helpful to you later in the semester if you have QGIS and PostgreSQL on the same system, and that system really shouldn't be Windows, but if you want to make "get QGIS running on Linux" into future-you's problem, that's between you and future-you (though we'll all help each other, no matter which stage we're at).

Once you have QGIS up and running, I'd like you to work through [this video](https://youtu.be/kCnNWyl9qSE). (You will have to hit pause and possibly also rewind. He goes fast. I _teach people_ QGIS, and I had to hit pause and rewind.) Explore QGIS. You don't need to be an expert when you show up next week&mdash;I'm going to walk you through several examples in-class&mdash;but if you've looked through it and figured out the basics, you'll get more out of the in-class session and be more likely to come up with questions that stump me. :)

Remember to log the time you spend.
