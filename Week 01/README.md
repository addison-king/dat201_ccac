Homework for this week

Obviously, **finish up your grade comparisons**. Come back next week ready to discuss what you've found out about different courses at CCAC and their grade distributions. (And what questions remain.)

You can upload your Excel files and a summary of your conclusions [here](https://acdccac-my.sharepoint.com/personal/edarsow_acd_ccac_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?e=5%3A0721e98802b54c18b12d59ea6e9a9dc2&at=9&CT=1580172664342&OR=OWA%2DNT&CID=fac0b577%2D44b5%2D1d03%2D2c90%2D9cc34d7ca0ee&FolderCTID=0x0120003C700CE6FEE4A548B6EB8A40653D4910&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fedarsow%5Facd%5Fccac%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fdata%5Fanalytics%2Fdat%5F201%5F20sp%5Fstudent%5Fwork%2Fdata%5Fcleaning%2Fgrade%5Fcomparisons)

**Also, there are some readings to do between this week and next:** (We'll discuss at the start of class.)
